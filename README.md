## <a id="description"></a>Description

Hiking Hub is an application for hikers looking to find out more about trails in their area.  HH allows the user to find trails around a city of their input.  A list of all nearby hiking opportunities are presented.  When the user selects a trail from the list rendered, an additional list of reddit posts related to the hiking trail is provided.  The user can then select a reddit post and read the post in detail.  This allows the user to find current or interesting hiker supplied information not availble in the parks official site.
